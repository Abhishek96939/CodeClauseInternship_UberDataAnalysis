# CodeClauseInternship_UberDataAnalysis
This Python code appears to be for an Uber data analysis project. Here's a summary of what each section of the code does:

1. **Data Understanding**:
   - Reads a CSV file named "UberDataset (2).csv" into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Displays basic information about the dataset using the `info()` method.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Fills missing values in the "PURPOSE" column with "UNKNOWN."
   - Removes rows with missing values in the "END_DATE," "CATEGORY," "START," and "STOP" columns.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Converts the "START_DATE" and "END_DATE" columns to datetime format.
   - Creates new features:
     - "TIME_DAY" representing the hour of the ride.
     - "TIME_OF_DAY" categorizing rides into morning, afternoon, evening, or night.
     - "MONTH_OF_THE_RIDE" representing the month of the ride.
     - "DAY_OF_THE_RIDE" representing the day of the week of the ride.
     - "DURATION_OF_THE_RIDE" representing the duration of each ride in minutes.

4. **Data Exploration**:
   - Provides summary statistics for the dataset, including mean, min, max, etc.
   - Displays the minimum and maximum timestamps in the "START_DATE" column.
   - Shows the number of unique categories in "CATEGORY" and "PURPOSE," as well as unique start and stop locations.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Generates various plots to visualize the data, such as:
     - Distribution of categories in "CATEGORY" and "PURPOSE."
     - Top 10 start and stop locations.
     - Distribution of rides by time of day, month, and day of the week.
     - Average ride start times by month.

6. The code ends by saving the cleaned data to a CSV file named "cleaning_uber_data."

This code is a comprehensive analysis of Uber ride data, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with this code or the analysis, please let me know.
